					<h2>What sort of costs should we expect, and at what stages will you bill&nbsp;us?</h2>
					
						<p>It is important to understand the costs involved in building your  website so you can budget accordingly. Providing an upfront deposit is  standard practice among professional agencies, with subsequent payments  due at key stages and a final payment upon completion; the deposit  typically ranges from 25-50% of the projected total cost. Most website  projects take around 2-6 months to complete, but schedules vary and  depend on the overall complexity of the project (web applications and  larger sites tend to take longer). Even with no delays, you often need  this much time for research, feedback rounds and writing all that&nbsp;content!</p>

				<section class="good-response">
					<h1><img src="../c/i/icon-checkmark.png" alt="" />Good response</h1>
					
						<p>Good web design takes time to research, plan and implement. On average, a project of this nature costs $15-20,000 <em>(example of a specific ballpark range) </em>and  takes us about four months to complete. Once we have more information  about your project, we will provide you with an estimate and proposed  schedule. We require a 25% deposit at the start of the project to begin  work, and we will invoice you based on specific project milestones; the  final payment will be due upon completion of the&nbsp;project.</p>
				</section><!-- end of .good_answer -->

				<section class="poor-response">
					<h1><img src="../c/i/icon-exclamation.png" alt="" />Poor response</h1>
					
						<p>I&#8217;m not sure how much it will cost, but we can usually get your website built for under $1000. You just pay us upon&nbsp;delivery.</p>

						<h1><img src="../c/i/icon-star.png" alt="" />Expert Tip</h1>
						<section>
						<p>In all likelihood, you will see a wide range of estimates from  different web professionals and agencies, but keep in mind that cheapest  is not always best. As they say, &#8220;you get what you pay for.<span class="final quote">&#8221;</span></p>
<p>There are several factors to keep in mind when evaluating an&nbsp;estimate:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The knowledge and skill level of the web professional or agency</strong> &ndash; You want to hire a competent agency, but your budget may not cover hiring a &#8220;rock star&#8221; web&nbsp;firm.</li>
<li><strong>The thoroughness with which they plan to approach your project</strong> &ndash; It&#8217;s often good to strike a happy medium between too much research and too little. The same goes for documentation (such as information architecture, user personas,  etc., which can become exhaustive tomes in no time) and browser  coverage (not everyone needs to support <span class="caps">IE</span>6). However, you should always  ask your professional to provide an estimate (and schedule) itemized by  phases so you can see where your money is&nbsp;going.</li>
<li><strong>The size of the agency</strong> &ndash; Larger agencies have more  staff with a broader range of skills to do the work and can probably  complete your project more quickly, but that also means they have more  overhead costs and are generally more expensive than smaller agencies.  Smaller agencies and individuals are, generally, more affordable and can  offer a more specialized service, but may need more time to complete  your project and are more likely to over commit themselves, taking on  too many projects at once, which can lead to missed deadlines. The size  and complexity of your project and how well the supplier can offer  long-term support may also influence your&nbsp;decision.</li>
</ol>
